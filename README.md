# Basic-HTTP-server
How to Do It (Step by Step)
Use req.url → This gives the URL the user visits (like /write or /read).
Check with if...else → Decide which code should run for each route.
Write or Read file using fs → Only when the correct route is visited.

How It Works

Visit http://localhost:3000/ → Shows a welcome message.
Visit http://localhost:3000/write → Creates example.txt with some text.
Visit http://localhost:3000/read → Reads and shows file content.
Visit any other URL → Shows 404 Not Found.
